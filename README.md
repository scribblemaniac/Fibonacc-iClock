Fibonacc iClock is a fibonacci clock implementation for iOS. This project is based off of [Thiago Sá's implementation](https://github.com/thiagotts/fibonacci-clock) of [Philippe Chrétien's fibonacci lamp](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/basbrun/fibonacci-clock-an-open-source-clock-for-nerds-wit). The graphics and exact minute display method in particular come from Mr.Sá so a huge thanks to him! Creating iOS app and design of the internal algorithms was done by scribblemaniac.

## How are these squares a clock?

The squares are a graphical representation of a fibonacci sequence. Looking at the colors in each square and doing a few simple math operations, you can determine the time within a minute precision. A excellent blog post detailing the exact method to use can be found [here](http://tts.eng.br/the-fibonacci-clock/).
